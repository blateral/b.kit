# Optional packages

## Map

> The Map component is made up with `leaflet`. Therefore the NPM Leaflet package must be installed to properly use all map features.

To diplaying the map in the right way you should also import the leaflet CSS styles:

As imports (e.g. in Nextjs `_app.tsx`):

```jsx
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

As CDN link (e.g. in Storybook `preview-head.html` or NextJs's `_document.tsx`):

```jsx
<link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.css"
/>
```

## Datepicker

To display datepickers inside forms you need to install the `react-datepicker` package from npm.

To diplaying the datepicker in the right way you should also import the react-datepicker CSS styles:

As imports (e.g. in Nextjs `_app.tsx`):

```jsx
import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css';
```
