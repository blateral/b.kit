# b.kit - React component library to b.uild awesome websites

The b.kit library consists of a set of essential React components that can be implemented and modified in any React project.
The goal is to reduce the need of rebuilding each component every time. Instead they are defined, tested and optimized in one library and can be reused in multiple projects.

See the up to date [Storybook stories](https://blateral.github.io/b.kit) of each b.kit component.

<br />

## Installation

Run

```
yarn add @blateral/b.kit
```

to install the component library. Because some packages like React, ReactDom and StyledComponents cannot run on multiple instances they are not included in the library.

> Therefore all peer dependencies must be installed seperately.

<br />

## Imports

The library exports all components as named exports so you can import and use them like:

```jsx
import { Article } from '@blateral/b.kit';

<Article
    title="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit."
    superTitle="Cum sociis natoque"
    text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
/>;
```

<br />

## Theming

Each component uses a default set of fallback styles that are bundled within the package. To override this styles the library uses the theme context of styled-components.
To use a custom theme the component must be wrapped within the exported library provider HOC component. All project specific style overrides can be defined through a
theme object and passed to the provider's `theme` property.

> Values like `undefined`, `null` or empty strings are ignored.

```jsx
import { Article, LibThemeProvider } from '@blateral/b.kit';

const customTheme = {
    colors: {
        primary: {
            default: '#2B4356',
            hover: '#009FE3',
            inverted: '#ffffff',
            invertedHover: '#009FE3',
        },
    },
};

<LibThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
    <Article
        title="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit."
        superTitle="Cum sociis natoque"
        text="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
    />
</LibThemeProvider>;
```

<br />

## Connectors

Connectors are used to connect b.kit components to data coming from a Content Management System (CMS). To date there two
connector packages available:

-   [b.kit MODX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blateral/b.kit-modx) `yarn add @blateral/b.kit-modx`
-   [b.kit PRISMIC](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blateral/b.kit-prismic) `yarn add @blateral/b.kit-prismic` (not maintained anymore. Not compatible with B.KIT 2 versions and version 2 beta releases!)
