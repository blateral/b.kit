# PriceList

The `PriceList` is intended to list priced elements, such as products or services.

<ArgsTable of={PriceListComponent} />

Each list item has props for `title`, `text` and `price`. The currency of the price element must be passed
to the component prop and is not auto included.

<ArgsTable of={PriceBlock} />
