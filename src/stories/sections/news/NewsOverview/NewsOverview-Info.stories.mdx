# NewsOverview

The `NewsOverview` is intended to list all news ordered by publish date. If supported by the browser an `Intersection Observer`
is used for infinity scrolling.

<ArgsTable of={NewsOverviewComponent} />

## Tag Filtering

To filter the list of news items you can define multiple `tags` that are displayed above the listing.
By default the filtering is done inside the section component. Active tags are defined by:

-   the `activeTags` array prop (good for initial server rendered version)
-   the `newsFilter` query parameter in the URL for forward and backward history navigation in browser. (is overriding `activeTags`)

The `newsFilter` query is also been updated on user's filter interactions (e.g. clicking on a filter tag). To disable this behaviour
and moving the filtering process out of the component you can use the `onTagClick` callback.
