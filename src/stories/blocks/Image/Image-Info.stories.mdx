# Image

The `Image` component displays images in every type and format in the best accessable way.

<ArgsTable of={Image} />

## Breakpoints

To avoid unnecessary huge images sizes on smaller viewports the component provides URL properties for multiple breakpoints.
`small` referes to the smallest possible screen width and is required.

## Layout Shifts

Layout shifts often occure if a height or width of a image are not defined. Therefore the browser can't reserve the space needed to display the image
until it's loaded. The following content experiences a shift in height if previous images are loaded. [See more](https://web.dev/cls/)

To prevent this behaviour the `Image` component wraps the HTML `img` tag with a container that maintains the expected space. This can be done by defining
the aspect ratios for at least one breakpoint in the `ratios` property. There're important points to consider:

-   You can define the ratios by relative values like `w=4 h=3` if the `coverSpace` property is set to true. The component now tries to span the image to the full parent width.
-   If `coverSpace` is set to false this won't work anymore. Instead you can define the ratios by absolute pixel values like `w=400 h=300` (400x300 px)
-   Older browser don't support the CSS attribute `aspect-ratio`. Images without `coverSpace` will still experiences layout shifts.
